# Paper on the new FamilyMemes evolutionary algorithm

Paper on a new memetic algorithms whose memes focus on partner selection, based on a question made by Antonio Leyva in Rafael Nogueras paper.

The basic idea is to have a "meme", a pattern selection pattern, that
evolves with every gene. What kind of memes might evolve? Will there
be any kind of improvement on basic evolutionary algorithm or
evolutionary algorithm with mating preferences? Is there a particular
kind of problem this algorithm will be more suited for?
